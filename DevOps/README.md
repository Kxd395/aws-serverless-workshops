# Serverless DevOps Workshop

This workshop has moved! The serverless CI/CD content is now included in [The Complete AWS SAM Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US).

We have updated the CI/CD modules to include steps to setup CI/CD using both [AWS CodePipeline](https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US/module-4-cicd/module-4-cicd-codepipeline) and [GitHub Actions](https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US/module-4-cicd/module-4-cicd-gh).

Keep an eye on [The Complete AWS SAM Workshop workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US) as we continue to add modules for different CI/CD provides as well as new modules about other features of SAM.
