# Amazon Sagemaker

A crash course introduction to Amazon Sagemaker for the Wild Rydes machine learning module.

## What is Amazon Sagemaker?
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.

## Why Do I need Sagemaker for this Workshop?
It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment.

During this lab you'll be asked to import data from multiple sources, manipulate the data, and format it to the syntax required to take advantage of the built in Sagemaker provided algorithms.  This will be completed within a python Sagemaker Development Notebook.

The last step of the `Additional Data Prep and Model Training` section leaves you in the Sagemaker notebook and instructs you to follow the instructions.  You'll need to **execute** each cell in the notebook to advance

## Executing a Notebook Environment
1. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing `shift + enter`.
1. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu `Cell -> Run All`.
1. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu `Kernel -> Restart`. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
